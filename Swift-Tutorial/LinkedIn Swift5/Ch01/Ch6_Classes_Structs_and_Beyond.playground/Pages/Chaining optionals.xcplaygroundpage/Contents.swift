 # Chaining Optionals
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 Optional chaining allows you to unwrap an optional type that has optional properties of its own. This is most common in classes or structs that contain optional custom types. Itâ€™s handy to think of optional chains in a very literal sense, like a chain link. If all the links are present and strong, the chain continues, but if one link fails, the chain breaks.
